What is Mutable String in JAVA. Explain with example.

	Mutable String in Java is such kind of a string which can be changed. 
	It is created by StringBuffer or StringBuilder.
	
	if we consider the following line of codes:
		
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("virat");
		sb.append("kohli");
		system.out.print(sb);
		
		the output will be: "viratkohli"
		we do not need to refer to another object, rather we can use the 
		same object sb, since it is mutable.
